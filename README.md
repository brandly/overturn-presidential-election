# overturn presidential election

What if, in a previous U.S. presidential election, you controlled not just a single vote, but an entire state's worth of votes. Could you have changed the outcome of the election?

Turns out, it depends heavily on the year.

```
1992

1996

2000
AL, AK, AZ, AR, CO, FL, GA, ID, IN, KS, KY, LA, MS, MO, MT, NE, NV, NH, NC, ND, OH, OK, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WY

2004
FL, OH, TX

2008

2000 was a heated election. 30 different states could have "single-handedly" changed the outcome.

Of the six elections that we have data for, four of them would've had the same outcome, even if an entire state had reversed their position.
