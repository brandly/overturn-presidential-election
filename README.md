# overturn presidential election

What if, in a previous U.S. presidential election, you controlled not just a single vote, but an entire state's worth of votes. Could you have changed the outcome of the election?

Turns out, it depends heavily on the year.

2000 was a heated election. 30 different states could have "single-handedly" changed the outcome.

Out off all the elections that we have data for, only four of them would've had a different outcome if an entire state had reversed their position.
